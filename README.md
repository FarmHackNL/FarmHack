# FarmHack

[FarmHack.NL](http://www.farmhack.nl/en/) is a catalyst for solutions, innovations and open collaborations in the agricultural and farming sector.

We mobilize coders, developers, creatives and domain experts to tackle challenges that stand in the way of widespread adoption of IT by farmers.

We organize hackathons, knowledge exchange events, bootcamps and help startups turn ideas into minimum viable products. 

Our motto is “make things open, it makes things better”.  

## Hackathons

We strive to organise open, inclusive and collaborative hackathons. 

- Smart Dairy Farming Hackthon [[announcement](http://www.farmhack.nl/activiteiten/smart-dairy-farming-hackathon/)] - a hackathon at the Smart Dairy Farming premises aimed at test driving their newly built infrastructure which gives farmers full control of their data.
