# Generate geojson from CROP-R API

To generate a geojson from the api follow the next few steps (on mac OS or Linux):

- Using the terminal go to the foler where this readme file is located.
- `chmod +x ./main.sh ./fetch-and-transform.py` To add execution rights to the files
- create the file: api-key.txt and add the line: CROPRAPIKEY=xxxx (where xxxx = the sessionid parameter in the crop-r cookie)
